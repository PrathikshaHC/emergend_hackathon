# Product Requirement Document (PRD)
## Project Name: RescuRoute AI – Closed-Loop Emergency Obstruction Response System

---

## 1. Executive Summary & Vision

### 1.1 Overview
In critical medical emergencies, response times are directly tied to mortality rates. Standard navigation systems passively inform drivers of heavy traffic or closed roads, leaving ambulance operators to navigate congestion reactively. 

**RescuRoute AI** introduces a **Closed-Loop Emergency Obstruction Response Agent** that actively intervenes in the physical traffic ecosystem. Beyond routing, the system automatically detects road blockages, classifies incidents, identifies nearest authorized traffic responders (e.g., tow trucks, traffic police), dispatches clearance requests, tracks clearance verification, and automatically escalates or reroutes the ambulance if clearance SLA windows are breached.

### 1.2 Key Differentiator: Closed-Loop AI vs Passive Navigation
| Feature | Traditional Navigation Apps | RescuRoute AI Closed-Loop System |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Obstruction Handling** | Passive alert / suggestion to reroute | Active dispatch of clearance teams + automated verification |
| **Response Window** | Driver decides alternate route after encountering traffic | Predictive clearance ETA vs alternate route ETA engine |
| **Multi-Agency Link** | None | Real-time link between Ambulance Operator & Traffic Control |
| **Failure Protocol** | Reroutes deeper into side-street gridlock | Automated multi-tier escalation + priority route green-lighting |

### 3.1 Step-by-Step Data & Operational Flow
1. **Trip Initialization**: Ambulance Operator selects Origin (`From`) and Destination (`To`). System generates optimal emergency route and initiates live GPS tracking.
2. **Obstruction Detection**: Continuous stream monitoring (CCTV feeds, dashcams, crowdsourced telemetry, IoT sensors) detects an anomaly along the active vector (e.g., *Junction 4: Broken-down vehicle, ETA impact +4 mins*).
3. **AI Classification & Responder Assignment**: Agent classifies problem severity and searches proximity index for available authorized responders (e.g., *Traffic Unit 7* or *Municipal Heavy Tow #4*).
4. **Clearance Request Dispatch**: Agent transmits priority dispatch request containing coordinates, vehicle type required, and ambulance arrival countdown (ETA 3 min).
5. **Closed-Loop Verification Loop**:
   * **Verification Check**: Agent monitors location sensor/camera feed or responder acknowledgement.
   * **SLA Threshold Check**: If clearance is not verified within threshold \(T_{\text{SLA}}\) (e.g. 90 seconds):
     * *Escalation*: Triggers secondary responder squad alert.
     * *Dynamic Reroute*: Evaluates if alternate path ETA < (Current Path ETA + Clearance ETA). If yes, issues dynamic reroute command to Ambulance Operator.

* **Live Telemetry Bar**:
  * Destination Name, Distance Remaining (km), Live ETA (mm:ss), Speed (km/h).
* **Obstruction Alert Overlay**:
  * Warning Card popup when an obstruction is detected along the route.
  * Fields: Junction/Location, Incident Type badge, AI Action status tag (*"Request Sent to Tow Unit #3"*), Countdown timer to clearance.
* **Manual Override & Reroute Prompt**:
  * Clear action buttons: `[Accept AI Reroute]`, `[Maintain Current Route]`, `[Voice Contact Dispatch]`.

### 4.2 Module 2: Traffic & Response Dashboard
* **City-Wide Control Hub**:
  * Multi-layer map showing all active ambulance corridors, traffic signal status, and field units.
* **Incident Alert Feed**:
  * Live cards displaying active emergency requests:
    * *Example*: `🚨 Emergency Request | Location: Junction 4 | Problem: Broken-down vehicle | Ambulance ETA: 3 min | Status: Responder Dispatched`.
* **Responder Dispatch Matrix**:
  * Real-time table of available units (Police, Towing, Highway Patrol, EMS) with status indicators (`Available`, `En Route`, `Busy`).
* **Closed-Loop Oversight Controls**:
  * Ability for control room operators to manually confirm clearance, reassign responders, or trigger green-wave signal overrides.

### 4.3 Module 3: AI Closed-Loop Response Agent Engine
* **Incident Classifier Engine**:
  * Categorizes obstruction type into standard ontology: `VEHICLE_BREAKDOWN`, `ACCIDENT_MAJOR`, `ACCIDENT_MINOR`, `ROAD_DEBRIS`, `ILLEGAL_PARKING`, `SIGNAL_FAILURE`.
* **Automated Clearance Dispatcher**:
  * Integrates via SMS, Webhook, REST API, or Push notification to send actionable clearance requests with geo-fence anchors.
* **SLA & Escalation State Machine**:
  * State lifecycle: `DETECTED` -> `REQUESTED` -> `ACKNOWLEDGED` -> `IN_PROGRESS` -> `VERIFIED_CLEARED` OR `ESCALATED` / `REROUTED`.
* **Comparative ETA Evaluation Model**:
  * Calculates \( \text{ETA}_{\text{current\_route\_cleared}} = t_{\text{travel}} + t_{\text{clearance\_est}} \).
  * Calculates \( \text{ETA}_{\text{alternate\_route}} = t_{\text{travel\_alt}} + t_{\text{delay\_alt}} \).
  * If \( \text{ETA}_{\text{alternate\_route}} < \text{ETA}_{\text{current\_route\_cleared}} - \Delta_{\text{threshold}} \), triggers mandatory reroute recommendation.
